This repository contains a simple Python script designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using user-provided inputs for height and weight. The BMI is calculated using the formula BMI = weight / (height ** 2), where weight is entered in kilograms and height in meters. After calculating the BMI, the script categorizes the result into standard categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity, based on widely accepted BMI ranges. The script includes basic error handling to manage cases of invalid input, such as non-numeric values or division by zero. To use the script, clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script using Python. You'll be prompted to enter your height and weight, after which the script will display your BMI and the appropriate category. This project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License. Contributions are welcome, so if you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
